# CONNECT FOUR

## Welcome message

Hi and welcome to Connect-Four; the game where the first player to place
four consecutive markers in a row, column or diagonal, wins.

The game board has 7 columns and 6 rows. You drop a marker by pressing on
the numbers 1 through 7 on your keyboard.

Player 1 has white markers and Player 2 has black markers.

Player 1 goes first. Good luck!

## Thoughts on the project

The purpose of this project was to get an introduction to test driven development.
Initially it was very difficult to know where to start, and which things to test first,
seeing as there was nothing to test initially. I solved the problem by first making
a rough outline of which classes should be included. Then I tried to decide which methods
should be included in those classes, and finally, which classes should communicate with
each other. 

TDD still feels cumbersome and like a counter-intuitive way of producing code. But as with
all things, practice makes perfect, hopefully.
